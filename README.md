# py-snake

## Overview

A simple Snake game written in Python, using [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) and [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html). This was a simple and straightforward tutorial and project, but did introduce the concept of classes to me long before I ever started looking at Java. The only course I have taken for Python (at the time of this writing) is Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) course on Udemy, which did not cover classes. Before this project, every Python project of mine was made without the use of classes or methods as a result.
